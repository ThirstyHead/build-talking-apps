------------------------- Step 1 of 2 : ASK CLI Configuration -------------------------
[Warn]: ASK CLI uses authorization code to fetch LWA tokens. Do not share neither your authorization code nor access tokens.
Switch to "Login with Amazon" page and sign-in with your Amazon developer credentials.
If your browser did not open the page, run the configuration process again with command "ask configure --no-browser".

ASK Profile "default" was successfully created. The details are recorded in ask-cli config file (.ask/cli_config) located at your **HOME** folder.
